        When I first came to Earth<br>
        using a UFO<br>
        Got warmth from a hearth<br>
        and then went to and fro.<br>
<br>
        No, I am not a pendulum<br>
        that oscillates about an axis<br>
        Neither did I fire a gun<br>
        nor I am from Texas.<br>
<br>
        You, now, might be thinking<br>
        Who I am?<br>
        I have eyes that are ever blinking<br>
        and I never spam.<br>
<br>
        I am, wait for it!<br>
        "Not a bird"<br>
        I wear a special outfit<br>
        and my name is not Edward.<br>
<br>
        I am a newbie,<br>
        (One who is new to something)<br>
        To a language known as "C"-<br>
        a language for Programming.<br>
<br>
        Yes, I am a programmer<br>
        and an expert too<br>
        in writing programs in R,<br>
        but this "C" is something new.<br>
<br>
        Now I will have to write<br>
        a "Hello World!" program in "C"<br>
        My device's screen is bright<br>
        I will have to let it be.<br>
<br>
        The "Hello World!" program<br>
        does not teach anything new.<br>
        That is what I feel<br>
        and this is my personal view.<br>
